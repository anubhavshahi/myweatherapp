# MyWeatherApp

My Weather App Project
I've been working on a simple Weather App that allows users to get the current weather information for any city they enter. The app is straightforward but covers essential aspects of web development, from HTML structure to JavaScript logic and CSS styling.

What the Project Does:
index.html:

This file is the backbone of my app. It lays out the structure of the page, with a clean and simple interface where users can input a city name and click a button to get the weather.
I've linked it with Bootstrap for a responsive layout and used Font Awesome for icons to make it visually appealing.
The file also connects to my custom styles in style.css and the weather-fetching logic in script.js.
script.js:

This is where the magic happens. I've written a script that listens for the Enter key or a button click to trigger a weather search.
When a user enters a city name, the script fetches weather data from a weather API. It then dynamically updates the page to show the current temperature, a brief description of the weather, and an icon that represents the weather conditions.
I’ve also added error handling, so if the user forgets to enter a city name or if something goes wrong with the API, the app will display an appropriate message.
style.css:

The styling is something I focused on to make the app not just functional, but also visually appealing.
I chose a weather-related background image to set the mood, and I styled the text input, button, and weather display to be both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
I also made sure the app is responsive, so it looks good whether you’re on a desktop or a mobile device.
My Process:
I started by sketching out what I wanted the app to look like and the basic functionality it should have. Then, I structured the HTML to provide a clean layout. The next step was writing the JavaScript to handle the user interactions and fetch the weather data. Finally, I styled everything to give it a polished look.

Uploading to GitHub:
To share my work, I made sure all the files—index.html, script.js, and style.css—were organized in a single folder. Then, I used Git to initialize a repository and committed my work. I pushed everything to GitHub, where anyone can see my code and even try out the app themselves.
